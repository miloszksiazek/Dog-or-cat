# Is it more a cat or a dog? 
This project is a machine learning application designed to classify images as either a dog or a cat. Using advanced deep learning techniques, the model analyzes image data and predicts the category with high accuracy.

Features
	‚Ä¢	Deep Learning Model: Leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for robust image classification.
	‚Ä¢	Image Preprocessing: Automated resizing, normalization, and augmentation of images to enhance model performance.
	‚Ä¢	User-Friendly Notebook: Includes an easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluation.
	‚Ä¢	High Accuracy: Tuned hyperparameters for improved performance on real-world datasets.
	‚Ä¢	Scalable: The model can be adapted for other binary or multi-class image classification tasks.

Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	Python üêç
	‚Ä¢	TensorFlow / PyTorch 
	‚Ä¢	NumPy and Pandas
	‚Ä¢	Matplotlib for visualizations

How It Works
	1.	Data Preparation: Load and preprocess image datasets (dogs and cats).
	2.	Model Training: Train the CNN on labeled images using supervised learning.
	3.	Evaluation: Assess model accuracy using test datasets.
	4.	Prediction: Use the trained model to predict whether an image is a dog or a cat.
